# httpfromtcp

HTTP/1.1 server from scratch implemented in Go - to better understand HTTP/1.1 and sockets.

Followed the ["From TCP to HTTP"](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-protocol-golang)
course on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev/). I can recommend this course to anyone
who wants to learn more about HTTP or TCP/UDP sockets. The course even has a
free full walkthrough video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FknTw9bJsXM).

Every commit contains one exercise from the course in chronological order.
